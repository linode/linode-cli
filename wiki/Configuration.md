# Configuration

The first time the CLI runs, it will prompt you to configure it.  The CLI defaults
to using web-based configuration, which is fast and convenient for users who
have access to a browser.

To manually configure the CLI or reconfigure it if your token expires, you can
run the `configure` command::
```bash
linode-cli configure
```

If you prefer to provide a token directly through the terminal, possibly because
you don't have access to a browser where you're configuring the CLI, pass the
`--token` flag to the configure command as shown::
```bash
linode-cli configure --token
```

When configuring multiple users using web-based configuration, you may need to
log out of cloud.linode.com before configuring a second user.

## Environment Variables

If you prefer, you may store your token in an environment variable named
`LINODE_CLI_TOKEN` instead of using the configuration file.  Doing so allows you
to bypass the initial configuration, and subsequent calls to `linode-cli configure`
will allow you to set defaults without having to set a token.  Be aware that if
the environment variable should be unset, the Linode CLI will stop working until
it is set again or the CLI is reconfigured with a token.

You may also use environment variables to store your Object Storage Keys for
the `obj` plugin that ships with the CLI.  To do so, simply set
`LINODE_CLI_OBJ_ACCESS_KEY` and `LINODE_CLI_OBJ_SECRET_KEY` to the
appropriate values.  This allows using Linode Object Storage through the CLI
without having a configuration file, which is desirable in some situations.

You may also specify the path to a custom Certificate Authority file using the `LINODE_CLI_CA`
environment variable.

If you wish to hide the API Version warning you can use the `LINODE_CLI_SUPPRESS_VERSION_WARNING`
environment variable.

You may also specify a custom configuration path using the `LINODE_CLI_CONFIG` environment variable 
to replace the default path `~/.config/linode-cli`. 

## Configurable API URL

In some cases you may want to run linode-cli against a non-default Linode API URL.
This can be done using the following environment variables to override certain segments of the target API URL.

* `LINODE_CLI_API_HOST` - The host of the Linode API instance (e.g. `api.linode.com`)

* `LINODE_CLI_API_VERSION` - The Linode API version to use (e.g. `v4beta`)

* `LINODE_CLI_API_SCHEME` - The request scheme to use (e.g. `https`)

Alternatively, these values can be configured per-user using the ``linode-cli configure`` command.

## Multiple Users

If you use the Linode CLI to manage multiple Linode accounts, you may configure
additional users using the ``linode-cli configure`` command.  The CLI will automatically
detect that a new user is being configured based on the token given.

## Displaying Configured Users

To see what users are configured, simply run the following::
```bash
linode-cli show-users
```

The user who is currently active will be indicated by an asterisk.

## Changing the Active User

You may change the active user for all requests as follows::
```bash
linode-cli set-user USERNAME
```

Subsequent CLI commands will be executed as that user by default.

Should you wish to execute a single request as a different user, you can supply
the `--as-user` argument to specify the username you wish to act as for that
command.  This *will not* change the active user.

## Removing Configured Users

To remove a user from you previously configured, run::
```bash
linode-cli remove-user USERNAME
```

Once a user is removed, they will need to be reconfigured if you wish to use the
CLI for them again.
