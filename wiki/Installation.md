# Building from Source

In order to successfully build the CLI, your system will require the following:

- The `make` command
- `python3`
- `pip3` (to install `requirements.txt`)

Before attempting a build, install python dependencies like this::
```bash
make requirements
```

Once everything is set up, you can initiate a build like so::
```bash
make build
```

If desired, you may pass in `SPEC=/path/to/openapi-spec` when running `build`
or `install`.  This can be a URL or a path to a local spec, and that spec will
be used when generating the CLI.  A yaml or json file is accepted.

To install the package as part of the build process, use this command::

```bash
make install
```
